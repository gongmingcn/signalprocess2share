# signalprocess2share
I have been developing the python code for multiple projects for years, and I learn a lot from github and stackoverflow. 

During my work, I develop some code for general signal processing purpose, and I would like to share some non-sensitive codes here,  hope it can also be used by others more or less.

## generate-certs_multiple_hosts.sh
One script to automatically generate TLS certificates for multiple hosts. Initially it is designed for the mosquitto application, and you can adapt it to any applications.
